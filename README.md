# SortBot: A Robotic Manipulator for Random Garbage Sorting
#### Efficient waste sorting with RGB-D perception, deep learning, and optimized motion planning
## Abstract
Waste management is a critical ecological and economic issue. SortBot is an autonomous robotic system capable of detecting, classifying, and sorting waste from a conveyor belt into separate bins in a recycling facility. This project tackles challenges like real-time pose prediction, grasp estimation, and collision-free trajectory planning. Using RGB-D cameras, deep neural networks, and Drake simulations, SortBot demonstrates potential to improve waste sorting processes in industrial recycling, paving the way for sustainable waste management.
### Features
